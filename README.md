This project consists of completing a recipe, as given by The Odin Project's project assignment
I would assume completing this assignment would demonstrate various skills with basic HTML, which sould include the following:

Headings
Lists (unordered and ordered)
Various elements (pargraphs, anchors)
Links, both relative and absolute

And likely many others!
