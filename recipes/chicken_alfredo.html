    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a really basic recipe for chicken alfredo! Note this recipe calls for store brought sauce and noodles, but feel free to make your own at home! 

        <br>
        This recipe is quite light on both kitchen utensils and overall effort - you'll just need a large pot, a pan, and a spoon or spatula! Feel free to make
        large portions as well - this alfredo keeps great for a few days in the fridge!
